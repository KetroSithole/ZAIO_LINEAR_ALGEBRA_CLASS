# Basic Vector Operations in Python

This guide introduces the fundamentals of working with vectors in Python using the NumPy library, essential for data engineering, data science, and machine learning tasks.

## What is a Vector in Linear Algebra?

In linear algebra, a **vector** is an ordered list of numbers representing magnitude and direction, often visualized as a column or row of components:

\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix}
\]

Key operations on vectors include:

- **Vector Addition:** Adding corresponding components of two vectors.
- **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying each vector component by a scalar.
- **Dot Product:** Sum of the products of corresponding components; used to measure similarity.
- **Magnitude (Norm):** Length of the vector, computed as the square root of the sum of squares of its components.
- **Normalization:** Scaling a vector to unit length.

## Why Use Vectors in Python?

Vectors are used for:

- Data transformation and cleaning
- Feature engineering in machine learning
- Scientific computing and simulations
- Improving performance with vectorized operations

## Example: Basic Vector Operations with NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Addition
print("Addition:", v1 + v2)

# Scalar multiplication
print("Scalar Multiplication:", v1 * 3)

# Dot product
print("Dot Product:", np.dot(v1, v2))

# Magnitude of v1
magnitude = np.linalg.norm(v1)
print("Magnitude:", magnitude)

# Normalize v1
unit_vector = v1 / magnitude
print("Unit Vector:", unit_vector)

# Division examples
v = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
v2 = np.array([2, 4, 5, 8])

# Element-wise division
print("Element-wise Division:", v / v2)

# Division by scalar
print("Division by Scalar:", v / 10)
